# NFT Staking Frontend

This frontend is a demo of how to interact with the staking program deployed to Solana Devnet at address `3pvNETr3Kqf4zTuUmfZUj3QzAHxAXk4icc7F5YsztLar`. You can find the code for that sample program [here](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/anchor-nft-staking-demo).

Note that both this frontend and the program it invokes are meant for illustrative and educational purposes only and **should not** be used in a production capacity. They're intentionally simplified for learners and consequently don't include myriad important security and performance measures. Use at your own risk.

### Setup

- Clone starter code
- Make sure your program is deployed to devnet or update frontend code here accordingly
- Copy your idl into `utils/idl` directory and update all references with the correct name
- Remove .example from `.env.example` then update values with your values
- Run `yarn` to resolve dependencies
- Alright letâ€™s go!
